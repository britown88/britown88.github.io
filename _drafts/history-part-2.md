Continuing where we left off with the power of cyan and magenta through 1984, IBM's EGA card made the computing world a more colorful place for years to come.

### IBM's Second-Generation PC

In fall of 1984, IBM released the followup to the very popular PC XT, dubbed the PC _AT_.

The AT stood for "Advanced Technology" and referred to a long list of features more or less unique among microcomputers.  The device launched with a 6 MHz Intel 80286 Processor, a memory capacity of up to 16 MB, a 20 MB hard drive, an exciting "High Density (HD)" 5Â¼ inch floppy disk drive, DOS 3.0, and a pricetag around six grand.

As with all of IBM's releases that decade, adoption was slow due to the expensive discomfort of shifting standards.  The AT was notorious for having an unreliable hard drive installed, caused by both faulty manufacturing and a bug in DOS 3.0's FAT filesystem.  The high density floppies rivaled competitors in size but the drive failed to be compatible with many more popular and accepted disks. It would take some time for IBM to release more popular revisions of the AT and, perhaps more importantly, for the "Clone Market" to spin up in full.

As with its predecessors, microcomputing competitors rushed to catch up with IBM's advance. As clones sprung up, and competition drove the prices down, the PC continued its rise to acceptance and dominance.  All new machines using the 286 processor were based on the AT and the term "AT-Class" came to be used for any machine that supported the features that once made the AT unique.  The feature-set inevitably developed into a widely-accepted industry standard for years to come. As a matter of fact, modern PCs still maintain near-complete backwards comaptibility with the PC AT (software-wise) well into the 21st century.

### Graphics Standards and the Video Games who loved them

#### EGA
Alongside the PC-AT (but not exclusively _for_) IBM released the _Enhanced Graphics Adapter_ (EGA) card.  The card was the vanguard of a significant jump forward in the graphical capabilities of the personal computer but its repercussions would take a few years to catch on.  If you read [part 1 of this series](/2017/01/24/super-ega-pt-1.html#legacy), I spoke briefly on the effects of EGA's release.

In 1984, many users were perfectly content on their CGA, MDA, or Hercules setups.  EGA's release drastically reduced the price of the "last model" and so XT (and even AT) -compliant clones were more than happy to throw a Hercules in the box to sell to the more cost-minded consumers. It wouldn't be until around 1986 that you could reliably expect to see a new piece of software support the EGA format.  King's Quest 3, one of the first games to support it, was released that year.

Part of what made the slow, 2-year switch to EGA possible at all was backwards compatibility.  The card featured a set of operating modes that were specifically dedicated to being fully compatible with CGA and MDA.  Even programs that made extremely low-level direct-memory-access calls to eek extra speed out of CGA would still run correctly on the new hardware.  This made the upgrade palatable to early adopters because all of their existing programs would still work.

#### All the Colors of the 6-bit Rainbow
The old CGA of '81 supported 16 kB of dedicated video memory rendering at a resolution of 320x200 with 4 colors from a 16-color palette or 640x200 monochrome.  The shiny new EGA card, by comparison, came equipped with a staggering _64 kB_ of memory. It could output to the 320x200 resolution with _16 colors at once_ from a 64-color palette. It even supported modes for a massive 640x350 resolution.  

What's more, the card featured an expansion slot and users could purchase an additional 64 kB of memory to double its capabilities. This allowed even the higher resolutions to support the same breadth of color.  EGA Clone cards from companies like ATI started shipping with all 128 kB available in their cards as standard and by 1987 it was exceedingly rare to have an EGA card in your PC that didn't have 256 kB to work with.
