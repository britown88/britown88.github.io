## What's all this then
This all started in fall of 2014 when I was toying with the idea of making a game in C as purely a journeyman endeavor.  I originally learned to program with C but it had been years since I coded without the comfort of C++ classes and the STL.  The game itself was going to be a text adventure with a robust modern parser but over time it shifted into being a graphical point & click adventure game.

I love old games, plain and simple.  I have a bit of a romantic view of the games industry of a quarter-century ago.  I am ceaselessly fascinated by the innovations and workarounds of developers of the late 80's and early 90's who made incredible things happen on what we now consider primitive hardware.  With the rise of the modern independant game we all saw a pretty dramatic resurgence of the pixel sprite.  "Retro" quickly became an art style as some titles shot for pure nostalgia while others experimented with elaborately complex pixel art that wouldn't have been feasible on old hardware.

Despite wildly differing opinions on whether or not this trend is _good_, few can argue that the exploration of the concepts has lead to some truly wonderful titles.  One particularly special entry was Shovel Knight, an extremely popular NES-inspired platformer from 2014.  Shovel Knight captured the look, feel, and magic of a mid-to-late era NES title while still employing modern design concepts to keep it fresh and near-universally approachable.

The thing I enjoyed the most about Shovel Knight was a Gamasutra post from the developer entitled [Breaking the NES for Shovel Knight](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/DavidDAngelo/20140625/219383/Breaking_the_NES_for_Shovel_Knight.php).  I highly recommend reading but the gist of it is that the stated goal of the game was to faithfully reproduce a "rose-tinted memory" of the NES.  Yacht Club Games put forward a remarkable amount of research effort into really understanding what made the NES tick.  By understanding the unbreachable, hardware-defined laws for what the system was capable of, they could then decide on which ones to tweak or altogether _break_.

The work behind Shovel Knight showed a care and reverence toward old tech that I enjoyed and appreciated deeply.  It got me thinking about my own "old game," the aforementioned C-based adventure game project.  I will always hold a special place in my heart for the old Sierra and (later) Lucasart adventure games, particularly King's Quest 1-3 and Hero's Quest (later renamed to Quest for Glory).  Before too long I started toying with the idea of my game looking and feeling like it was released for DOS in 1988.  It was around this time that I fell into a deep and dark hole of researching old computer [graphics hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_card#History) and [display standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_display_standard).
