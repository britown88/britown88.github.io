### Hello
I've spent the last half-decade or so attempting to find some sort of acceptable definition for the concept of a personal side project.  It's been a messy journey from naively over-optimistic to depressingly cynical and then right back to naively optimistic. If nothing else, I like to think I've grown a fondness for stroking a proverbial beard over what it means to make a game for fun.  I thought maybe I would write some of that shit down instead of bothering people with it in person.

### Projects
* [sEGA](https://github.com/britown88/sega) - Tinkering with graphical limitations from the late 80's has spawned an engine for making games that look that way.
* [BladeQuest](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bladequest.world) - A retro-RPG passion project that never saw a satisfying completion.
* [DilloDash](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.horse.ddash) - A silly little thing I made around the grand flappy-bird gold rush.
* Unfinished/Unseen Projects A1 through E74 - Unlisted
