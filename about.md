# Hello
I'm Brandon and I like video games.

# Projects
I like playing them and occasionally set my mind toward making them

* [sEGA](https://github.com/p4r4digm/sega) - Tinkering with graphical limitations from the late 80's has spawned an engine for making games that look that way.
* [BladeQuest](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bladequest.world) - A retro-RPG passion project that never saw a satisfying completion.
* [DilloDash](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.horse.ddash) - A silly little thing I made around the grand flappy-bird gold rush.
* Unfinished/Unseen Projects A1 through E74 - Unlisted
